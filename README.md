🌟 Overview

Welcome to the Restaurant App — a fully native Android experience that blends technology and taste like butter on hot parathas! 😋
Crafted passionately in Java and Kotlin, this app brings you a smooth, delightful food ordering experience with zero third-party dependencies (because who needs extra weight, right?).

It’s modern, it’s multi-lingual, it scrolls infinitely (almost like your food cravings), and it updates dynamically — because your cart deserves real-time love too.
